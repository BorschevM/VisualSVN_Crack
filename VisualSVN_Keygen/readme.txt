VisualSVN Add-In for Visual Studio
http://www.visualsvn.com/visualsvn/


General Description
===================
Subversion is a perfect version control system. VisualSVN makes Subversion
easy to use for Visual Studio developers. By integrating Subversion to
Visual Studio VisualSVN improves yours productivity and reduces
the probability of routine mistakes.

VisualSVN is conceptually based on the principle of “transparent Subversion”.
VisualSVN automatically reflects all actions to Subversion from Visual Studio
that happen in the daily development cycles. For example, VisualSVN automatically
marks all newly added files and folders as added. This transparent behaviour
allows you to concentrate on development, while VisualSVN takes care off versioning.
